The advent of social media sites offers many new sources of data to analyse and use in novel ways. We have now available a vast amount of information about people, brands and corporations -- what they say and what is said about them, who they connect to and who connects with them, how they respond to events and become authorities on events. Wars, sport, elections, floods, famines can all be viewed through the lenses of social media activity.

In particular, sentiment analysis techniques can be applied to analyse the influence and reach of brands and people. This analysis will most likely involve the following steps: gathering data from a social media forum (e.g. Twitter), categorising and clustering the data based on features and on sentiment; and identifying trends in the data.


#### Generating and visualising predictions in social media

With the richness of data available in social media, much focus has been placed on generating useful predications regarding data, places and people. This project will focus on two research questions â€“ how best to generate a prediction based on the existing sources of evidence and secondly how best to explain the prediction in a visual manner. Analysis of user behaviour when given these explanations will be undertaken.


#### Personalised user interaction in social media systems

Retrieval and organisation of data and information from social media systems (e.g. Facebook and Twitter) is a very active area of research which poses several challenges to researchers and developers (scale of data, heterogeneity, real-time retrieval). This project will involve researching and developing suitable user interaction models based on users' multiple needs. The goal of the project is to identify task at hand, users' interests, users' interaction style/model and to present information and paths to information based on those tasks and interaction styles.


#### Analysis and predication of growth in dynamic graphs on social media

The increased use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter has led to the growth of research into such graphs. One of the open questions is to predict the growth of such graphs and the spread of information through these graphs. In this work, graphs will be built based on interconnections between people (and clusters of people). Properties relating to the growth of such graphs will be captured. Data mining approaches will be used to predict new connections in the graph and also to predict what type of behaviour will lead to activity by other posters. In order to attempt to predict this will mine the relationships between graph properties, user activities and the resulting activities by other users.

#### Detecting Structures in Complex Social Networks using Evolutionary Algorithms
Being able to detect structures in complex social networks, such as cliques on Twitter graphs, is critical as it allows the ability to locate and identify links between structures and functions. By identifying various communities we can provide information as to how the network functions and the impact of topologies. There are a number of different approaches used in the detection of structures and this research focuses on the use of evolutionary algorithms to identify various communities.
