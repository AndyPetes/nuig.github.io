#### Examining the use of Evolutionary Algorithms in Evolutionary Game Theory
Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is the application of game theory to evolving populations on artificial life organisms. EGT allows the researcher to examine dynamic games, which are centered, not by the idea of rational players, but on the population dynamics. This project examines the use of evolutionary algorithms and their representations in the study of population dynamics. The project examines the effects of altering the representation of the evolutionary algorithm to introduce a number of biological concepts and to analyse the impact of a multi-layered representation on population dynamics.

#### Complexity and difficulty in strategy games
This project will explore the relationship between the complexity of a game (search space, repetition, deceptive paths) and the notion of ’difficulty’ that a player may experience playing the game. The research will focus on a family of well defined strategy games (e.g. Mancala games) and will categorise a number of these in terms of complexity. Variants of the games with different levels of complexity will also be explored.
