# Computational Intelligence Research Group (CIRG)

We are the Computational Intelligence Research Group at the National University of Ireland Galway, and this is the source code of our [website](https://nuig.github.io). It is powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) and based on the clean and nice [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme.

What is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)? It is just a static site generator. Want to know more? watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWowJBRMtpc).
